## Tests

**TSDynamicUrls** for Google Forms unit tests can be found in [form/tests](/form/tests/) folder.

To perform **TSDynamicUrls** for Google Forms unit tests:

* Add the appropriate test file from the [form/tests](/form/tests/) folder to the TSDynamicUrls form script editor.  ***IMPORTANT: Each test is configured as a web app so only install one test at a time to avoid conflicts.***

* Install [QUnit for Google Apps Script](https://github.com/simula-innovation/qunit/tree/gas/gas) by adding the project library *(see the project documentation for proper install instructions)*.

* [Deploy the script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web#deploying_a_script_as_a_web_app) as a web app *(execute script as self)*.

* Set the desired unit test configuration entry in the `testConfig` object to `true` *(see each file for information on where to modify these values to enable tests)*.   NOTE: Some tests can take longer to run so best to run them individually.

* Access the deployed web app for test results.
